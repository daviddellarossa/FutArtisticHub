        "description": "The Reactable is a revolutionary collaborative instrument composed of a round, translucent table that is usually situated in a dark room. The table is lit up, and blocks called &quot;tangibles&quot; are placed on the table by performers. The tangibles represent different modules of a synthesizer (such as sequencers and VCOs). Performers then manipulate the tangibles on the Reactable to create a custom digital song. As the tangibles move, they create motions and light movements on the table, making the Reactable both an instrument and visual display.",
