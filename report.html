            <h1>Report: Large Coursework </h1>
            <h4>by David Della Rossa</h4>
        </div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Thinking about a possible theme for my project, I wanted to do something close to my interests and passions.</p>
        <p><strong>Art</strong> is one of may favourite passions. I love art, basically every type of art, especially new, experimental, innovative forms of art, being it music, graphic art, code art, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Technology</strong> is my other great passion, so big that I have made it my work. I am really excited about everything in technology. I think I'm very lucky to be alive in this moment in time,
                when so big a technical revolution is happening in just a few decades, with so deep consequences in our daily life.<br />
        Thinking why I am so in love with technology brings me to when I was a kid, fond of science-fiction. I wanted to live in, or at least to taste, the future. Today it is basically the same. So I realized that
            what I am still fond of, is the idea to be in the future.</p>
        <p>Coming back to my project, I wanted to create an environment to talk about these two things: <strong>Art</strong> and <strong>Future</strong>, and how the two can influence each other.</p>
        <p>I named my project <strong><em>FutArtisticHub</em></strong>, by melting two words, <em>Futuristic</em> and <em>Artistic</em> and I wanted to talk of how art can influence our future, changing our perception of esthetic,
            and how technology can change art and our way of producing art.<br />
            How can we confront our need to express our art with new forms of expression generated by algorithms, neural networks, artificial intelligence?<br />
            Can the latter be considered art? Can a human artist get enriched by interacting with a non-human artist?</p>
        <p>To realize this idea, I have chosen the structure of a <strong>web-magazine</strong>.<br />
            The <strong>home page</strong> is the main page of the magazine, with articles and news published by the staff.<br />
            A section of the web site is dedicated to artists and their art.<br />
            The main page of the <strong>Artists</strong> section shows a slideshow with a selection of artists, followed by a list of all other artists highlighted by the staff, with a photo and a brief description.<br />
            Clicking on any of the artists, we land on the artist personal page, with a long description about the artist, with a slideshow dedicated to her and more photos in the body of the article. <br />
            Further down, there is a section with other media content about the artist, like a selection of videos from youtube, followed by a list of references and links about the artist.<br />
            A third section is called <strong>Artworks</strong> and it is thought to highlight media content talking about interesting interactions between art and technology.</p>

        <h2>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</h2>
        <p>As I listed in the Introduction, my personal interests have inspired me in choosing the topic, Art, Technology and their interaction ,in producing a new interpretation of art and,
            why not, maybe also this will be helpful in considering the machines a bit less inhuman than they are today.</p>
        <p>When I was still scouting for the topic, I found a lot of interesting material already on the web about this argument.<br />
            Many artists currently use various forms of technology to produce their art. And this has always happened. This made me even more curious.<br />
            For example, <em>Mario Klingemann</em>, a german artist that makes use of neural networks and algorithms to express his art; or <em>Joshua Stanton</em>, with his artistic works in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality.</p>
        <p>An article, found on the <a href="https://time.com/">Time web site</a> [30] <cite><a href="https://time.com/5435683/artificial-intelligence-painting-christies/"><i>A Painting Made by Artificial Intelligence Has Been Sold at Auction for $432,500</i></a></cite>,
            talking of a painting made by Artificial Intelligence sold at auction for more than $400000, impressed me a lot. I did not think that an artifact made by AI could be worth that huge amount of money.</p>
        <p>The more I thought about that idea, the more I was convinced that that was the right topic for my project.<br />
            Create a community of people, a point of aggregation for anyone interested in how the ideas we have of the future can materialize in new concepts of art, that might act as a hub where people with different abilities can meet and cooperate.</p>
        <p>The people visiting my web site would be artists, photographers, painters, but also developers, designers, and more in general art-lovers, tech-lovers, future-lovers.<br />
        Everybody here might share their visions and get enriched by other points of view.</p>

        <h2>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h2>
        <p>All images have <em>alt text</em>. See <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-content">Non-text Content 1.1.1</a> </span>.</p>
        <p>The layout of the web site does not make use of tables or other convoluted structures, but is indeed quite simple. See <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#tables-layout">HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a> </span>.</p>
        <p>The colours of text and background for the various sections of the website have been checked to have the right contrast with this <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">Contrast Checker from Web AIM</a> and the results are:<br />

            <span class="text-info">Main menu items vs background: Contrast Ratio: <strong>7.38:1</strong></span> - <span class="text-success">All Pass</span>.<br />
            <span class="text-info">Normal text vs background: Contrast Ratio: <strong>9.08:1</strong></span> - <span class="text-success">All Pass</span>.<br />
            See <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#contrast-minimum">Contrast (Minimum) 1.4.3</a></span>
        </p>
        <p>All form elements include labels that describe their meaning. See <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#labels-or-instructions">Labels or Instructions 3.3.2</a></span>.</p>
        <p>Paragraphs, titles and various sections of the site are well separated with padding in order to improve readability. See <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#section-headings">Section Headings 2.4.10</a></span>.</p>
        <p>3 different designs for three viewport sizes, Mobile phone, Tablet and Wide screen, have been created. See <span><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/#h-small-screen-size">Small Screen Size</a></span>.</p>

        <h2>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h2>
        <p>The web site is pretty simple, with clear sections and linear flow. Every page of the web site is maximum two clicks away from the home page. </p>
        <p>To move from a section to another, simply click on the menu items on the header navigation bar, or on the showcase images, or on the titles on the articles or the artists' names. In any case, the links to move around are clearly visible.</p>
        <p>The slideshow has not automatic transactions among images and also provides controls to browse images at will.</p>
        <p>The web site uses fonts very clear to read and with a font-size large enough not to stress the eyes during the reading.</p>

        <h2>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</h2>
        <h4>Handlebars</h4>
        <p>After having studied Handlebars in this course (Web Development), which was a completely new topic for me, I was wondering how I could apply those concepts to a real case.<br />
        This project gave me the occasion of thinking in practical terms on how I could make good use of Handlebars, for not only a mere substitution of a few strings.</p>
        <p>I imagined that the strings to be inserted in the Handelbars placeholders could come from a json file, instead of being hardcoded into the html file.</p>
        <p>This is the behaviour I wanted to implement: calling one of the pages of the site, the page template (index.html, for example) would load in the browser.<br />
            On page load completion, a javascript call would retrieve the json document, containing the content for that page, from the web site.<br />
            Javascript would then feed Handlebar with the json document, which would finally replace the placeholders sparse through the page with their actual content.</p>
        <p>With this idea in mind, I had to provide a way of retrieving such json documents. <br />
            Using a server side language to build a web api, to server such json documents, was out of scope for the project, therefore I had to desing a mechanism to read the files from the same web site using client-side code.<br />
            Again, Javascript had everything I needed to do the job. Of course, doing this way the json documents are static documents, already prepared and residing on the server.
            However, replacing these json files with a web service, which returns a json document dynamically built based on the content of a database, would make this mechanism much closer to a real case.</p>

        <h4>Asynchronous Javascript</h4>
        <p>While writing the javascript code to retrieve the json documents, I found an unexpected issue that needed to be solved.<br />
            It happened that I called the jQuery method <code>$.get(...)</code> to retrieve the json file and populate a variable called <code>jsonContent</code>.
            The following line in the code tried to access the content of <code>jsonContent</code> variable just (really?!) created by the previous line of code, but found it empty even though the <code>$.get()</code> call had not failed.</p>
        <p>Debugging and inspecting what was happening, I realized that the <code>jsonContent</code> variable was not just empty, it was <em>still</em> empty.
            And it was empty because the previous call <code>$.get()</code> had not yet returned, being asynchronous.
            Therefore I had to find a way to wait for that call to return before executing the next line.</p>
        <p><code>$.get()</code> actually accepts two delegate functions, <code>done()</code> and <code>fail()</code> to manage the two cases, and these delegates are only called upon completion.
            Putting the execution of the next lines within the <code>done()</code> function would have solved the problem, but required some structural changes to my javascript code.</p>
        <p>A second solution I found is using the <em>async function declaration</em>.
            A function that executes asynchronously can be declared asynchronous (<code>async function asyncCall(){}</code>).<br />
            To call the function and wait for it to complete, there is another instruction <code>await</code>, so that the call looks like this: <code>await asyncCall();</code>.<br />
            This indeed solved the problem.</p>
        <p>The downside of this method is that it has been introduced in <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/8.0/#sec-async-function-definitions">ECMAScript 2017 Language Specification</a>, thus it is not supported by browsers prior 2017.
        Opting for the implementation of the <code>done()</code> and <code>fail()</code> delegates of the <code>$.get()</code> function, would have wider support from the browsers.
            However, I chose the method based on <code>async/await</code> because I am interested in expanding my knowledge about the language, using features i had never used before and,
        although browser compatibility is a problem that every web developer has to face, learning new aspects of the language is also equally important.</p>

        <h4>Sass and SCSS</h4>
        <p>I had heard that Sass and SCSS are helpful tools to manage css documents, but I had never tried them. This was the right occasion to do so.</p>
        <p>The IDE I use for web development is <strong>JetBrain WebStorm</strong>. It supports Sass and SCSS, but requires an extension to be installed, necessary to compile the Sass/SCSS code into css on the fly. Following the instructions on the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/transpiling-sass-less-and-scss-to-css.html">WebStorm</a> website, I easily manage to have my IDE able to compile Sass/SCSS code.</p>
        <p>Learning to use SCSS is very easy, as its syntax is compatible with css, but with a lot of useful additions, like <strong>variables</strong>, <strong>operators</strong>, <strong>functions</strong>, <strong>nested nodes</strong> and much more.</p>
        <p>I found it effective and intuitive, especially when I was tweaking the colours to fulfill the accessibility requirements.
            Having defined variables for colours, I could just change the value of one colour once in one place and have it done, instead of searching and replacing everywhere, which takes time and is prone to errors.
            The same when I was choosing the right combination of fonts.</p>
        <p>The content of the stylesheet.scss file is accessible <a href="./css/stylesheet.scss">here</a>.</p>


        <h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h2>
        <p>The design of the website based on handlebars, javascript and json to do <em>client side templating</em> was completely new to me, and initially I was not sure it would have worked or else it was a complete waste of time.
            It indeed worked. I am very happy with it and I think it is pretty interesting.</p>
        <p>In this project, the json files containing the content of the pages are on the file system in the same website, are called by the client-side code and statically server by the web server.
            But they could otherwise be returned by a web service or a web api just changing the links, and the web site would still work without big changes in the structure.</p>

        <h2>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h2>
        <p>As I said, the json files are static. One improvement could be to setup a web service to dynamically serve those document, based on the content of a database.</p>
        <p>Initially, I chose the argument of the articles, found pictures on the web, and tried to put the text together, with the information found on various articles on other web sites.
            However, a preliminary check for similarity highlighted all those articles as plagiarism, therefore I decided to take the text out and replace it with <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>.
            Working in a professional environment as a software developer, I am always provided with the texts to insert in a website, written by people very good at that.
            Also, I think Lorem Ipsum for this purpose is a very helpful tool in that a programmer can concentrate on those aspects more related to coding without loosing too much time writing pieces that will surely and rightly
            be replaced by more valuable content written by specialized people.</p>
        <p>When I came to the styling of the web site, I wanted to use SCSS, which was a completely new technology for me. This brought me to start trying and testing on how to obtain the result I wanted.
            The css built ended up being conceived with a wide-screen-first approach, only because it was quicker to work with, while discovering the features of SCSS.
            The next time I would like to start the css with a mobile-first approach and use more features of SCSS to make the css code even more readable and easy to modify.</p>
        <p>If this website had to go live, I would think of replacing the <code>async\await</code> instructions with code more widely supported from old browsers, like I mentioned earlier.</p>
